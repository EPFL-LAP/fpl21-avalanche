The channel composition of this architecture was set to mimic that of Agilex [Chromczak2020], apart from the H12 and the V8 wires which are likely routed at Mz layers,
not modeled by our FPGA'21 flow. Other than that, the architecture has little in common with Agilex and is much closer to K6_N10_40nm.xml, shipped with VPR.
This includes monolithic local interconnect, kept for easier packing, even though at 4nm it is not an optimal design choice. This will be rectified once the local
interconnect is explored as well.
